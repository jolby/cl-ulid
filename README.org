#+title: ULID implementation in Common Lisp

* A ==ULID== is a ==universally unique lexicographically sortable identifier==.

It is:

- 128-bit compatible with ==UUID==
- 1.21e+24 unique ULIDs per millisecond
- Lexicographically sortable!
- Canonically encoded as a 26 character string, as opposed to the 36 character UUID
- Uses Crockford's base32 for better efficiency and readability (5 bits per character)
- Case insensitive
- No special characters (URL safe)

In general the structure of a ULID is as follows:
   01AN4Z07BY      79KA1307SR9X4MV3
  |----------|    |----------------|
   Timestamp          Randomness
     48bits             80bits

* Installation
cl-ulid is not in quicklisp. It will need to be installed in the local-projects quicklisp directory:

#+begin_src bash
  > cd /USER_HOME/quicklisp/local-projects/
  > git clone https://github.com/jolby/cl-ulid.git
#+end_src

* Basic Usage at the REPL
#+begin_src lisp
CL-USER>(ql:quickload :cl-ulid)
> (:ULID)
CL-USER> (ulid::make-ulid-string)
>
#+end_src
